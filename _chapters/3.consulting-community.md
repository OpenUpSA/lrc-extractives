By the following month, September 2008, the Minister of Minerals and Energy wrote to the LRC in response to the internal appeal. The Minister stated that the conditional mining rights would not come into effect until a representative from the Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) had held public hearings and consulted with the traditional leaders of the greater Amadiba community.

The greater Amadiba community is one of the most underdeveloped areas in South Africa and lacks basic municipal services such as power lines and plumbing. The mine has thus caused a division in the community as some members whose rights would not be directly affected hoped that it would bring jobs and development. 

This deep split in the community has led to a pattern of violence in which community activists working to protect the cultural and environmental heritage are being targeted.

> Has your community been consulted?

In February 2011, almost three years after the announcement of the suspension of TEM’s conditional mining rights, the Minister appointed a task team to consult the community. After consultation processes, the DME is obligated to issue a decision within x days. The delayed action of the DME to issue a decision led the ACC to submit a complaint to the Public Protector.

A decision was then issued by the DME in June 2011 in which TEM’s conditional mining rights was suspended on the basis of certain environmental requirements remaining outstanding.

<p class="edu-title">What is a Complaint?</p>

This includes (1) a definition of what a complaint is, (2) how, where and to whom a complaint is submitted, (3) requirements and criteria for submitting a complaint, (4) how to obtain the documentation upon which your complaint is based, (5) how and where to track results of your complaint, and (6) where can communities look for extra information concerning this matter (resources).

Although the DME eventually held a public hearing with the greater Amadiba community, it is the DME’s obligation / responsibility to formally consult the community prior to issuing any rights related to mining activities.

	Internal appeal process and access to courts.—
	<ol>
		<li>Any person whose rights or legitimate expectations have been materially and adversely affected or who is aggrieved by any administrative decision (So ANY decision that an official takes and that will affect your rights (for example I will lose access to my shared grazing land) can be challenged within 30 days. So a short time!) in terms of this Act may appeal within 30 days becoming aware of such administrative decision in the prescribed manner to—</li>
		<ul>
			<li>the Director-General, if it is an administrative decision by a Regional Manager or any officer to whom the power has been delegated or a duty has been assigned by or under this Act;</li>
			<li>the Minister, if it is an administrative decision that was taken by the Director-General or the designated agency.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>(a) An appeal in terms of subsection (1) does not suspend the administrative decision, unless it is suspended by the Director-General or the Minister, as the case may be.<br>
		(b) Any subsequent application in terms of this Act must be suspended pending the finalisation of the appeal referred to in paragraph (a).</li>
		<li>No person may apply to the court for the review of an administrative decision contemplated in subsection (1) until that person has exhausted his or her remedies in terms of that subsection.</li>
		<li>Sections 6, 7 (1) and 8 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, 2000 (Act No. 3 of 2000), apply to any court proceedings contemplated in this section.</li>
	</ol> 
	 
	<ul>
		<li>The community must make out an argument in their appeal to say why activities must be suspended pending the appeal. Very important.</li>
		<li>I did an internal appeal in 2010. In 2017, we received notification that we were successful. However, mining had not been suspended so the mining was finished by the time we won!</li>
		<li>How can you track the results of your appeal?</li>
		<li>Only through corresponding with Department. Very frustrating and difficult.</li>
	</ul>
