The members of the Umgungundlovu community pride themselves on a long history of occupying, owning and using their land.

During the 1800s the Zulu Kingdom often prevented other communities from practicing their customs and traditions. The forebears of the Umgungundlovu community emigrated from Zululand to preserve the Mpondo culture.

Therefore the Umgungundlovu community, situated in Bizana, Eastern Cape, has a history in the region that is over 200 years old.

In 2002, a new threat to the Umgungundlovu community appeared on the horizon:
An Australian mining company was granted <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#prospecting-rights" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="prospecting-rights"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> prospecting rights</a> which would allow them to freely move across this land to determine if there are mineral deposits worth exploiting. The prospecting rights would last for five years and included a strip of coastline more than 21 kilometers long and extending, at some points, almost two kilometers inland.

	In accordance with the Minerals and Petroleum Development Act 28 of 2002, the term "prospecting" refers to: <span class="edu-definition">intentionally searching for any mineral by means of any method</span>

The Australian mining company, Mineral Commodities Ltd (MRC), owner of the South African subsidiary Transworld Energy and Mineral Resources SA (Pty) Ltd (TEM), intended to extract the heavy minerals from the sands in this area. TEM estimated that five per cent of the sand is made up of valuable heavy minerals such as titanium.

Mining threatens the livelihood of the Umgungundlovu community whose social structure is invested in the land. The land is fertile for farming and offers the community grazing for their livestock as well as natural resources for traditional harvesting. The Umgungundlovu community also assigns cultural value to the land in which “umzi” (a residential plot) symbolises social maturity and social dignity. It is more than just a place in which to live.

Furthermore, the prospective region for mining forms part of South Africa’s natural heritage and is known as the Pondoland Centre of Endemism, which is home to 200 different plants that are not found anywhere else in the world.

At this crucial point, in a battle that has spanned 15 years to date, the community of Umgungundlovu remain unaware of TEM’s plans for the region. Thus the Umgungundlovu community was unable to take legal action against TEM’s search for heavy minerals on their lands.
