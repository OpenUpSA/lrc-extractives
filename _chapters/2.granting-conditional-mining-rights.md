	<p class="edu-title">What are conditional mining rights?</p>

	<p>When a mining company is granted ‘conditional’ mining rights, it means that mining rights to the land has been granted to that company, although solely on a ‘conditional’ basis.</p>

	<p>The conditions that a mining company has to meet to begin mining activity on the land are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>That the mining company is granted mining rights to the land</li>
		<li>Has a fully approved Environmental Impact Assessment report (EIA)</li>
		<li>Has sent out a letter of notice to landowners and/or individuals currently occupying the land that they will enter the land within 30 days</li>
	</ul>
 
	<p>The time that it takes to meet, review and approve each of these conditions are different and the granting of the mining right takes this into consideration. That is why a mining company can hold their mining rights ‘conditionally’ prior to the final approval of the EIA, as this process takes the longest of them all.</p>
 
	<p>The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) does not follow the belief that communities need to see the mining right. As a result, in order to view it communities often turn to other legal processes to gain access to these documents - such as the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) or the court system.</p>
 
	<p><strong>How can communities and legal representatives monitor the status of the conditional mining right?</strong></p>

	<p>The status of a conditional mining right at this stage can only be monitored through the ongoing processing and approval of the EIA.</p>

Mining applications divide the land into smaller areas or “blocks”. These blocks allow mining companies to strategize their mining activities for the duration of their contract.

TEM found that the Kwanyana block had the richest reserves of titanium in the area. This made the Kwanyana block a top priority over all other blocks for mining activity.

The granting of the conditional mining rights pose an immediate threat to the Xolobeni village which is the closest village, within the Umgungundlovu community, to the Kwanyana block. This would involve the displacement of the Xolobeni villagers which directly affects their customary law.

> How and where can your community find out if a mining company has been granted prospecting, conditional, or mining rights to your land?

The customary law of the Umgungundlovu community is deeply rooted in the shared history, culture and interests of the community. The community’s customary law emphasises the responsibility of maintaining a lifestyle that values natural resources such as land. Furthermore, the respect given to ancestral gravesites would cause displaced villagers to experience the degeneration of umzi institutions.

While the Xolobeni village does not fall within the Kwanyana block, this land forms part of communal land that is utilised by the greater Umgungundlovu community, the use of which is governed by their customary law.

The ACC only became aware of the granting of a conditional mining rights license to TEM once it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange - almost three weeks after the right was granted.

On behalf of the ACC, the LRC took the second legal action against the mining company by launching an  <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#internal-appeal" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="internal-appeal"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> internal appeal</a> against the awarding of the license.
