TEM had been awarded <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#conditional-rights" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="conditional-rights"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> conditional mining rights</a> by August of 2008. The conditional rights allowed TEM to begin mining operations in the most important of the five blocks involved, the Kwanyana block.

Mining applications divide the land into smaller areas or “blocks”. These blocks allow mining companies to strategize their mining activities for the duration of their contract.

TEM found that the Kwanyana block had the richest reserves of titanium in the area. This made the Kwanyana block a top priority over all other blocks for mining activity.

The granting of the conditional mining rights pose an immediate threat to the Xolobeni village which is the closest village, within the Umgungundlovu community, to the Kwanyana block. This would involve the displacement of the Xolobeni villagers which directly affects their customary law.

> How and where can your community find out if a mining company has been granted prospecting, conditional, or mining rights to your land?

The customary law of the Umgungundlovu community is deeply rooted in the shared history, culture and interests of the community. The community’s customary law emphasises the responsibility of maintaining a lifestyle that values natural resources such as land. Furthermore, the respect given to ancestral gravesites would cause displaced villagers to experience the degeneration of umzi institutions.

While the Xolobeni village does not fall within the Kwanyana block, this land forms part of communal land that is utilised by the greater Umgungundlovu community, the use of which is governed by their customary law.

The ACC only became aware of the granting of a conditional mining rights license to TEM once it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange - almost three weeks after the right was granted.

On behalf of the ACC, the LRC took the second legal action against the mining company by launching an  <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#internal-appeal" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="internal-appeal"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> internal appeal</a> against the awarding of the license.

<div class="edu-segment collapse" id="eia">
	<div class="edu-title">Environmental Assessment Report</div>
	<p>The EIA has 2 components: a scoping report and an Impact assessment. The scoping report must:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>describe the methodology applied to conduct scoping;</li>
		<li>describe the existing status of the environment prior to the mining operation;</li>
		<li>identify and describe the anticipated environmental, social and cultural impacts, including the cumulative effects, where applicable;</li>
		<li>identify and describe reasonable land use or development alternatives to the proposed operation, alternative means of carrying out the proposed operation and the consequences of not proceeding with the proposed operation;</li>
		<li>describe the most appropriate procedure to plan and develop the proposed mining operation;</li>
		<li>describe the process of engagement of identified interested and affected persons, including their views and concerns; and</li>
		<li>describe the nature and extent of further investigations required in the environmental impact assessment report.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There is first a draft scoping report – community can insist on giving the opportunity to comment. There is sometimes a scoping meeting with affected parties but it is not a requirement.</p>
	<p>Then they proceed to a status quo report and a draft EIA – for comments.</p>
	<p>Then final EIA.</p>
