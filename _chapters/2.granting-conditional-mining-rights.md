TEM had been awarded <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#conditional-rights" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="conditional-rights"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> conditional mining rights</a> by August of 2008. The conditional rights allowed TEM to begin mining operations in the most important of the five blocks involved, the Kwanyana block.

Mining applications divide the land into smaller areas or “blocks”. These blocks allow mining companies to strategize their mining activities for the duration of their contract.

TEM found that the Kwanyana block had the richest reserves of titanium in the area. This made the Kwanyana block a top priority over all other blocks for mining activity.

The granting of the conditional mining rights pose an immediate threat to the Xolobeni village which is the closest village, within the Umgungundlovu community, to the Kwanyana block. This would involve the displacement of the Xolobeni villagers which directly affects their customary law.

> How and where can your community find out if a mining company has been granted prospecting, conditional, or mining rights to your land?

The customary law of the Umgungundlovu community is deeply rooted in the shared history, culture and interests of the community. The community’s customary law emphasises the responsibility of maintaining a lifestyle that values natural resources such as land. Furthermore, the respect given to ancestral gravesites would cause displaced villagers to experience the degeneration of umzi institutions.

While the Xolobeni village does not fall within the Kwanyana block, this land forms part of communal land that is utilised by the greater Umgungundlovu community, the use of which is governed by their customary law.

The ACC only became aware of the granting of a conditional mining rights license to TEM once it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange - almost three weeks after the right was granted.

On behalf of the ACC, the LRC took the second legal action against the mining company by launching an  <a class="info-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#internal-appeal" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="internal-appeal"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> internal appeal</a> against the awarding of the license.

<p class="edu-title">What is an Internal Appeal?</p>
This includes (1) a definition of what an internal appeal is, (2) how, where and to whom an internal appeal is launched, (3) requirements and criteria for launching an internal appeal, (4) how to obtain the documentation upon which your internal appeal is based, (5) relevant legal arguments used in an internal appeal of this nature, (6) how and where to track results of your internal appeal, and (7) where can communities look for extra information concerning this matter (resources).
