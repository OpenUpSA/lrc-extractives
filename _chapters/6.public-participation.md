During the course the ongoing legal battle, at the close of 2015, it came to the attention of the greater Amadiba community that in May of the same year, the local Municipality of Mbizana secretly and unilaterally made policy amendments that designated part of the coastal strip, including communal land, as appropriate for mining purposes.

Not only had they rezoned this land from a protected area to one suitable for mining, but had done so in a way that implied mining operations were already underway in the region.

The municipality leveraged both the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act and the Municipal Systems Act when they prepared the Spatial Development Framework (SDF) for the area.

> Are you aware of how your local municipality has prepared its Spatial Development Framework for your land?

From the time the community was made aware of this, for a period of one year, they were engaged in a drawn out correspondence with their local Municipality and other government bodies demanding a correction be made to the SDF. 

When the community struggled to find success through correspondence, in December 2016 the community launched a review application in the Mthatha High Court seeking the correction of the SDF in a court case that is still currently pending.

This includes (1) a definition of what a review application is, (2) how, where and from whom are review applications submitted, (3) requirements and criteria for preparing a review application, (4) how does one obtain access to the documentation upon which your review application is based, and (5) where can communities look for extra information concerning this matter (resources).

Matters, however, might only be made worse by a proposed law, i.e. the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Bill, that seeks to remove the land rights from communities living on communal land.

This proposed law works against the structure of customary law by giving authority to traditional leadership to make decisions to trade communal land on behalf of the entire community. This disrespects the consensual core of customary law in which a community engages in extensive consultation prior to decision-making.

To further aid their court case the community proceeded to file a comment on the status quo report prepared by consultants in preparation of the Municipal Environmental Management Framework in terms of the National Environmental Management Act.

[Comment segment]: this includes (1) a definition of what a comment is, (2) an understanding of the requirements and criteria to be met for commenting on a status quo report, (3) how, where, and to whom is a comment filed, (4) how does one obtain access to the documentation on which the comment is based, and (5) where can communities look for extra information concerning this matter (resources).
