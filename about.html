			<h1>About the LRC</h1>
			<p>The South African Constitution, often noted as one of the most progressive in the world, provides a firm foundation for all who live here to realise their basic human rights and dignity. However, despite the promise of progressive rights, South Africa has struggled to ensure that freedom and democracy deliver opportunities for economic and social advancement. As a result, poverty and inequality persist on a scale that threatens the achievement of the transformation envisaged by the Constitution.</p>
			<p>In order to provide greater access to justice and to ensure that the Constitution and the law work for all who live in South Africa, the Legal Resources Centre (LRC) provides free legal representation to poor and marginalised individuals and communities. This allows the LRC and our clients to apply the law to ensure that their rights are protected and promoted by a range of duty bearers. The LRC is not a single-issue focused organisation. We engage in litigation in relation to a broad scope of human rights issues. We are unique in that we address the intersectionality of rights and advocate for more comprehensive solutions to deeply entrenched, systemic challenges.</p>
			<p>The LRC is a registered non-profit organisation and South Africa’s largest pub­lic inter­est human rights law clinic. Estab­lished in 1979, at the height of apartheid, the LRC provided free legal services to poor people and communities whose human rights were systematically violated. It continues to provide services in order to protect and promote the rights in the Constitution. </p>
			<p>The LRC has four regional offices in Cape Town, Dur­ban, Grahamstown and Johan­nes­burg and operate satellite offices in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and the Eastern Cape. </p>
			<p>The LRC’s work centres around eight focus areas: Community Access to Land and Resources, Environmental Justice, Housing, Evictions and Local Government Planning, Education and Children’s Rights, Equality and Non-Discrimination, Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Migrant Protection, Openness and Accountability and Access to Justice and Civil Society support. </p>
			<p>While the main thrust of our work lies in strategic impact litigation, whereby we represent clients in cases that will achieve precedent-setting judgments, the LRC employs a number of modalities to achieve its goals. We provide legal advice and support, training for legal professionals in order to strengthen the public interest law sector, undertake advocacy and rights awareness through workshops with client communities, as well as research and global and regional engagements around human rights issues.  </p>
			<p>The primary aim of the LRC’s land rights work is to assist in the realisation of the constitutional imperative that the state must take legislative steps and other measures to foster access to land and natural resources on an equitable basis.</p>
			<p>We seek to promote communities affected by development as central to decision-making about such development, to further transparency and accountability in government and business, restitution and reparation for past injustices and to secure rural livelihoods and promote of sustainable development.</p>
			<p>LRC land reform work draws from many years of experience resisting forced removals and, since 1994, assisting client communities to secure land-based livelihoods in terms of post-apartheid land reform policies.</p>
			<p>The LRC also focuses on communities affected by the extractives industries. We defend their right to say “no” or to give their Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) to development affecting them, as well as enhancing their ability to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and regulations relating to environmental and occupational health. We are also concerned with the protection of labour rights.</p>
			<p>A particular focus of the LRC’s work in the regional and international context is on activities in the extractives sector and the effect mining has on local communities, the obligations of business to protect and fulfil human rights, and the recognition of customary tenure.</p>
